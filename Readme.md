## Important Security Notes

### **Do Not Use in Production**
The provided credentials are for development and testing purposes only. They should never be used in a live production environment.

### **Enhance Security**
For improved security, it is highly recommended to manage sensitive information such as credentials using environment variables or a `.env` file. This practice helps to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive data.

### **Regenerate Exposed Credentials**
If you accidentally expose any sensitive credentials, it is imperative to immediately regenerate and secure them to prevent unauthorized access.
